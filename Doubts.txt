 Find the intersection point in 2 linked list.

First question to find the median of two sorted arrays of varying sizes, explain all the base cases and the logic as well.
Search for an element in a row and column sorted 2D matrix in O(log n) time.

You are given a pen. A person could either enter the bid price or selling price or ask to match the highest bidding price and lowest selling price.
What data structure will you use for string the prices.

Given an integer array of n integers, find sum of bit differences in all pairs that can be formed from array elements. Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is count of different bits at same positions in binary representations of x and y. 
For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2. Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 ( first and last bits differ in two numbers).
